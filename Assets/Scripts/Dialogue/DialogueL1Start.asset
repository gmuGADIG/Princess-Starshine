  text: "Imp: Ay lady, here\u2019s ya stop.\r\nPrincess: Aw thanks! What a fun ride,
    the music in there just made me wanna dance the whole--- {interupt}\r\nImp: See
    ya\u2019 lady, I'm outta 'ere. {imp_leave}\nPrincess: What an adorable little
    critter, oooooh I just wanna give him a squeeze, he\u2019s so cute! :3\n{princess_walk_around}\r\nPrincess:
    Wowie-zowie, this isn\u2019t my bedroom! What a lovely change of scenery, it\u2019s
    so warm and cozy.\nPrincess: OMG, I can\u2019t believe Papa never told me about
    the castle sauna! It\u2019s so cool! I can\u2019t wait to explore!!!\n{virgil_enter}\r\r\nVirgilUnknown:
    Uh, hello? You certainly aren\u2019t from around here.\r\nPrincess: Ooh what
    an adorable little critter! I just wanna scoop you up and kiss you!!!!\r\nVirgilUnknown:
    I most certainly would NOT want a kiss, or a scoop for that matter. And I\u2019m
    not a critter- I am Virgil the Talking Skull, nothing more, nothing less.\r\nPrincess:
    A skull? I have one of those too! OMG we have so much in common!!!\nVirgil: Well
    that is certainly a stretch but yes, I suppose I do have some similarities to
    you, flesh-haver. But I digress- what ever led you to coming here of all places
    while you still remain alive?\r\nPrincess: Who, meeee? Papa said I spread my
    happiness too much and that the kingdom needed a little break! So he like, totally
    locked me in my room and stuff! Which like, totes makes sense! Papa is sooooo
    smart and he knows the perfect answer to everything!!\r\nVirgil: Uh-huh\u2026\r\nPrincess:
    Yup! So anyways, I was in my bedroom, my closet opened up and there was this
    total cutie-patootie in there with his \u2018wittle tuxedo and his \u2018wittle
    tiny hand and AAAAHHHH!!! He was so cute so I had to go see em!!\r\nVirgil: \u2026Uh-huh\u2026\r\nPrincess:
    So anyways, I took his super-duper-awesome-and-cool elevator all the way here
    to this basement sauna! Isn\u2019t that SOOO COOL?????!!!!\r\nVirgil: A sauna??!!...
    (wait\u2026 an elevator took her here\u2026 this might be my chance\u2026)\r\nVirgil:
    Ahem, that certainly is a um\u2026 cool\u2026 story? By the way, what would happen
    to be your name madame?\r\nPrincess: Oh me? I\u2019m Princess Starshine, the
    one and only! I love all things sweet, and all things cute, and all-\r\nVirgil:
    Yeah okay Ms. Princess Starshine, that\u2019s a uh... wonderful name! And this
    is a wonderful castle sauna! Say, it\u2019s really hot in here, how about we
    go back up to that elevator, my good ol' pal?\r\nPrincess: Go back already? But
    I just got here! I wanna see all the sites, all the wonderful people, and all
    the wonderful sweets and treats! Only after I\u2019ve seen aaaaaabsolutely everything
    will I go home!\r\nVirgil: Home you say?\r\nPrincess: Yup! The absolutely BEAUTIFUL
    Kingdom my Papa runs, it\u2019s always so colorful, and happy, and amazing, and
    all the animals are so so SO cute, and-\r\nVirgil: Well Ms. Princess Starshine,
    I uh, happen to be a um, a\u2026 Tour Guide\u2026! Yes, a tour guide here in
    hel- I mean, in the sauna! How about I give you a tour of all there is to see,
    so that we- I mean, you, can go home!\r\nPrincess: Ooh that sounds like so much
    fun! :3 You\u2019re so smart Virgil!\r\nVirgil: Ah well, anything for someone
    as kind as you, Ms. Princess Starshine. Say, do you know how to navigate around
    here yet?\n{prompt_tutorial_skip}"
