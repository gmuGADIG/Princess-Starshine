    I\u2019m Princess Starshine!\r\nBaelUnknown: Ahh! A princess! Finally, someone
    who can appreciate the order and refinement of-\r\nPrincess: What\u2019s your
    name?\r\nBaelUnknown: I am the hellish Bael I. Frittata, Marquess of Flames,
    the fourth in my line, Royal-\r\nPrincess: I\u2019m calling you Bae Bae!\r\nBaelBaeBae:

    the reorganizing we did\u2026\r\nBael: Pardon?\r\n{view_damage}\r\nBael: \u2026WHAT?\r\nBael:
    Princess, I have expended my last formality and I must ask you that-\r\nPrincess:
    Sorry, I got distracted. What did you say?\n{screen_shake}\r\nBael: RUAGHHHHHH!!!!\r\r\nPrincess:
    Awwww, is Bae Bae a gwumpus wumpus?\n{virgil_leave}\r\nVirgil: Well, now you\u2019ve
    done it\u2026\r"
