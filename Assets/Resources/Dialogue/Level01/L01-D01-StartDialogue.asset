    happiness?\r\nPrincess: Yup! I was just playing in my room and opened my closet,

    um, a\u2026 Tour Guide\u2026! Yes, a tour guide here in hel- I mean, in the sauna!
    How about I give you a tour of all there is to see, so that we- I mean, you,

    the rules down here in h- the sauna!\r\nPrincess: Oh boy! I love pamphlets that
    have been picked up off the ground!\r\nVirgil: I-I-I didn\u2019t pick it u-up
