  text: "OfficeBoss: So that\u2019s the general idea. What do you guys think?\r\nYesMan1:
    Brilliant!\r\nYesMan2: Excellent!\r\nYesMan3: Masterful gambit, sir!\r\nNoMan:
    Eh, I dunno.\r\n{turn_to_no_man}\r\nOfficeBoss: 136.94.216.35\r\nNoMan: H-how
    do you know that?\r\nOfficeBoss: Do you want to find out?\r\nNoMan: Uh\u2026
    no, no, it\u2019s a great idea.\n{away_from_no_man}\r\nOfficeBoss: Alright, it\u2019s
    official. The work day is now 25 hours long! %%Boss_Glad I thought of that\r\n{virgil_look_at_bael}\r\nVirgil:
    Hey, didn\u2019t we kill you?\r\nBael: Ahem, um, no.\r\nVirgil: So\u2026 what
    are you doing here?\r\nBael: This is my day job. I have a life outside of you.\r\n{boss_look_at_princess}\r\nOfficeBoss:
    You there, nameless employee, go tell everyone that the work day has been extended.\r\nPrincess:
    Wow, this place is soooo big! There are so many shiny things in here!\r\nOfficeBoss:
    They are shiny, aren\u2019t they? I earned them. From my dad. Who gave them to
    me. Maybe if you get back to work, one day you could too.\r\nPrincess: Oh, we
    don\u2019t work here! :3 %%Princess_hehe\r\nOfficeBoss: Well in that case you\u2019re
    both hired! \r\nPrincess: Really?\r\nOfficeBoss: Yes! Now get back to work.\r\nVirgil:
    Yeah, well, we quit.\r\nOfficeBoss: Well in that case you won\u2019t be receiving
    your severance package! %%Boss_Inconceivable\r\nVirgil: Then fire me!\r\nOfficeBoss:
    Fine! You\u2019re fired! %%Boss_You_re Fired\r\nVirgil: You can\u2019t fire me,
    I quit! %%Virgil_Hehe, no\r\nOfficeBoss: Ok, this isn\u2019t getting us anywhere.
    If you\u2019re not here to work, you\u2019re useless to me.\r\n{yes_men_move}\r\nOfficeBoss:
    Nothing personal. It\u2019s just (my dad's) business. %%Boss_Sales Are Goin Up"
