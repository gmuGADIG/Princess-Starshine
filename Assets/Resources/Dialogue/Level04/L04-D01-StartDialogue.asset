    starting to feel my fingers again\u2026 %%Virgil_Yes, Absolutely\r\nPrincess:
    But Vi-Vi, you don\u2019t have fingers! %%Princess_Besties\r\nVirgil: Well, the
    tour must continue on! Let\u2019s see, given the wretched smell in the air, we
    must be at the Industrial Domain. %%Virgil_Yes, Absolutely\r\nPrincess: Indestreel?
    That sounds like some fancy-pantsy knight name! %%Princess_So Many New Friends\r\nVirgil:
    Oh right, you\u2019re a princess from an old-fashioned kingdom. As your trusty
    tour guide, let me explain! Hell- I mean, the Sauna, is much more technologically
    advanced than your kingdom, so we can manufacture a variety of high end prod-
    %%Virgil_Hehe, no\r\nPrincess: Ooooh! What\u2019s that? %%Princess_Yippee\n{princess_move_to_poster}\r\nVirgil:
    \u2026Are you even listening to me? %%Virgil_Sigh\r\nPrincess: Nope! :3 %%Princess_Its
    Me Princess Starshine\r\nVirgil: I can\u2019t believe this\u2026 %%Virgil_Eh,
    I suppose\r\nPrincess: Who's that girl in the painting? %%Princess_So Many New
    Friends\n{virgil_move_to_poster}\r\nVirgil: Oh, her. That\u2019s Becky... She\u2019s
    the idol of Hell- the Sauna, with fans from all seven Domains, as well as the
    leader of this place. Her careless nature is why this place is such a dump\u2026
    %%Virgil_What do You want\r\nPrincess:  She looks so nice! I wanna have tea with
    her! What's she doing in that painting? %%Princess_Besties\r\nVirgil: That *painting*
    is a Hellywood movie poster for her upcoming film: Resident Good 11, where she
    fights with a machine gun against a horde of humans who are trying to make her
    eat vegetables. Truly vile things. %%Virgil_Yes, Absolutely\r\nPrincess: That\u2019s
    sooooooo cool! %%Princess_Yippee\nPrincess: Well, onwards, Vi-Vi! I wanna check
    out that radioactive waste over there! %%Princess_Sparkle On \n{princess_move_right}"
