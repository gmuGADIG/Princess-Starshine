  text: "Virgil: And\u2026we\u2019re here\u2026I\u2019ve heard rumors of this place\u2026but
    it\u2019s truly so horrifying in person\u2026h-hey, Princess, could we go back?
    A-a place like this is-\r\nPrincess: OMG! I love this place! All the purples
    and blacks just go together so well! It could use a little more pink though\u2026
    And wowwwwww!!! Look at the apartments here! Everyone looks so happy and cozy!
    %%Princess_Oh My Gosh\r\nVirgil: Princess! T-this is the last floor\u2026and
    the\u2026you know\u2026devil lives here? The boss man\u2026 I-if he finds us
    after what we- %%Virgil_Eh, I dont think so\r\nPrincess: Oh, the devil lives
    here? I can\u2019t wait to meet him! I\u2019ll ask him how much one of these
    rooms cost, Papa will so totally get me one! %%Princess_So Many New Friends\r\nVirgil:
    P-princess, if the devil finds us he\u2019ll-\n{princess_walk}\r\nPrincess: Laadeelaadeeda~
    %%Princess_Sparkle On\r\nVirgil: Oh dear\u2026\u2026think, Virgil, think! \u2026Ah!
    %%Virgil_Wait a Minute\n{virgil_walk}\nVirgil: Princess, I know you really want
    one of these apartments, but they are incredibly popular and the queue to get
    one is quite long...\nVirgil: Perhaps you could find a place of residence elsewhere?
    Like a cozy bedroom in a castle, just like the one you have back home! let\u2019s
    go there!\r\nPrincess: But this place looks sooooo much cuter than a boring old
    castle! Maybe Mr. Nice-Devil can make me a new one! Papa says I\u2019m sooooo
    cute that no one can resist when I ask for something!\r\nVirgil: Is there no
    escape from this crazed woman\u2019s insanity\u2026 %%Virgil_Sigh\r\nPrincess:
    Hm? Did you say something, Vi-Vi?\r\nVirgil: Nope! Nothing at all! Although,
    given that this is the last floor, it seems like our journey together is almost
    complete. Even I\u2019m starting to get a little sentimental. %%Virgil_Hehe,
    no\r\nPrincess: Aw, thanks Vi-Vi. <3 Anyways, look! A playground! %%Princess_Besties\n{princess_walk_off_screen}\r\nVirgil:
    That\u2019s a torture device, not a- PRINCESS, NO!"
