  text: "Princess: Who\u2019s that?\r\nVirgil: T-t-the devil\u2026\r\n{reveal_evil_princess}\r\nEvilPrincess:
    Hello, Princess Starshine.\r\nPrincess: Woah! You look just like me! Except like,
    a lot of things! Am I looking in a mirror that makes you look boring?\r\nVirgil:
    No, Hell Mirrors don't work that way\u2026 \r\nPrincess: Well golly gee, then
    who could she be?\r\nEvilPrincess: Don\u2019t you know? It\u2019s Newton\u2019s
    4th law: for every person, there exists an evil and opposite doppel-person. Well,
    I guess it\u2019s not a surprise you don\u2019t know it. Not after EVIL Newton
    crossed it out of his notes.\r\nPrincess: No way! Does that mean you\u2019re
    MY evil doppel-thingy? We could have sooooo many tea parties together!\r\nEvilPrincess:
    HA! You wish. You\u2019re MY evil doppelg\xE4nger. And you know what? For a while,
    I could almost tolerate your existence. Every yin must have its yang, as they
    say. Probably.\nEvilPrincess: But then\u2026 it started. The glitter, the sparkles\u2026
    people DIED, Starshine. My own doppelg\xE4nger, killing people with kindness\u2026\nEvilPrincess:
    INSTEAD of VIOLENCE!\nEvilPrincess: Where\u2019s the carnage? The gut spilling,
    visceral brutality!? YOU MAKE A MOCKERY OF EVERYTHING I STAND FOR!\r\nVirgil:
    So then what do you want?\r\nEvilPrincess: Ahem- In accordance with \u201CThe
    Devil Clause,\u201C whoever kills the Devil takes their place as ruler of Hell.
    You could remake this whole place as you see fit. And after I went through the
    hassle of sending that elevator through a broken shaft for you, I think you owe
    me one.\r\nPrincess: I don\u2019t know what a \"Deviled Claws\" is, but I can
    do whatever you need me to~~!\r\nVirgil: Is that really what you\u2019re getting
    at? You want her to kill you? (And here I thought SHE'D be the sane one\u2026)\r\nEvilPrincess:
    What I\u2019m \u201Cgetting at\u201C is a battle to the death. Beauty on blood,
    cuteness on cruelty, sparkles on slaughter. Whaddya say?\r\nPrincess: \u201CBattle
    to the death\u2026\u201D IS THAT A FASHION SHOW!? abso-sparkle-lutely!! I\u2019m
    in!!\r\r\nEvilPrincess: Well, it\u2019s been nice knowing you\u2026 NOT!\r\nPrincess:
    ...\nEvilPrincess: ...\n{virgil_leave}\nVirgil: ..."
